## Preface
The introduction of vector fields allows us to understand and mathematically model a vast array of phenomena where both *magnitude and direction* vary over space. It provides a way to capture the idea of a vector quantity (such as velocity, force, or magnetic field) at every point in a given space or region, which is essential in many areas of science and engineering generally described by partial differential equations (PDEs). **Vector calculus** studies the (partial) differentiation and (multiple) integration of vector fields. It features three key differential operators, i.e., grad, div and curl, and several related theorems and identities.

Therefore, mastering this knowledge proficiently helps us gain a deeper understanding of various complex physical phenomena and also allows us to apply these theorems and equations to draw interesting and meaningful conclusions in our own specific research fields. However, I found myself often confused by their definitions during my previous studies, without a unified perspective to think about the connections between them, which led to a shallow understanding of these concepts and a rather vague memory of them. So, in this blog, I hope to clarify the definitions of *gradient*, *divergence*, and *curl*, as well as the corresponding theorems, including *Green's Theorem*, *Gauss's Theorem*, *Stokes' Theorem*, and the *Green's Identities*. I hope this will contribute, even if only in a small way, to both my own understanding and that of the readers.

## Gradient
### Coordinate-free Definition
The **gradient** is a vector-valued function corresponding to a multivariable real-valued differentiable function `$f: \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$`, denoted `$\nabla f$`. And in the context of field theory, it can also be viewed as a differential operator that maps a scalar field into a vector field (`$\nabla f: \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$`).

The expression `$\nabla f(p)\neq 0$` identifies a vector that points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of `$f$` at point `$p$`, with its magnitude indicating the rate of increase in that direction. In contrast, `$\nabla f(p)=0$` actually indicates the existence of a stationary point. The "gradient" can be defined in a coordinate-free manner, that is,
`$$\mathrm{d}f=\nabla f\cdot\mathrm{d}\pmb{x}, \tag{1} \label{eq1}$$`
where `$\mathrm{d}f$` is the total infinitesimal change in `$f$` resulting from an infinitesimal displacement `$\mathrm{d}\pmb{x}$`. `$\nabla f$` is defined as the gradient of `$f$`, and is also commonly denoted as `$\mathrm{grad} f$`. It can be seen that the change in `$f$` is maximized when the infinitesimal displacement is aligned with the direction of the gradient, which corresponds exactly to the physical interpretation of `$\nabla f$` that we discussed earlier. Equation `$\eqref{eq1}$` also shows the relation between the total differential of a function and its gradient.

The dot product of `$\mathrm{grad}f$` with any vector `$\pmb{l}$` at point `$p$` is the **directional derivative** of that function along `$\pmb{l}$`
`$$D_{\pmb{l}}f(p)=\left(\nabla f(p)\right)\cdot\pmb{l}.$$`

### Representation in Cartesian Coordinates
When `$f$` is represented in a coordinate system with an *orthonormal* basis, the corresponding gradient is given by an `$n$`-dimensional vector consisting of partial derivatives of `$f$` at point `$p=\left(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n\right)$` (if `$f$` is differentiable at `$p$`), i.e.,
`$$\nabla f(p)=\left[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(p),\cdots,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(p)\right]^\mathrm{T}, \tag{2} \label{eq2}$$`
here, `$\nabla=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1},\cdots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_n}\right)$` is the *nabla operator*. Specifically, for three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (with `$\pmb{i},\pmb{j},\pmb{k}$` being the standard unit vectors along `$x,y\text{ and }z$` coordinates), the gradient takes the form
`$$\nabla f=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\pmb{i}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\pmb{j}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\pmb{k}.$$`

### Generalization
For a differentiable vector-valued function `$\pmb{f}: \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$`, the gradient of `$\pmb{f}$` is a matrix of size `$m\times n$`, known as the **Jacobian matrix**
`$$\nabla\pmb{f}\triangleq\pmb{J}=\left[\frac{\partial\pmb{f}}{\partial x_1},\cdots,\frac{\partial\pmb{f}}{\partial x_n}\right]=\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\left(\pmb{e}_i\otimes\pmb{e}_j\right),$$`
where `$\otimes$` denotes the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product) operation, `$i=1,\cdots,m;\ j=1,\cdots,n$`. `$\pmb{e}_i$` are orthonormal basis vectors.

Gradient plays a fundamental role in a wide range of scientific fields, from helping optimize machine learning models (such as the classic gradient descent and [automatic differentiation](https://xiweipan.com/en/2024/11/24/automatic-differentiation/#automatic-differentiation-ad) algorithms) to modeling physical systems and designing engineering solutions.

## Divergence
### Coordinate-free Definition
The **divergence** is a differential operator that maps a vector field `$\pmb{F}$` to a scalar one. In physics, it represents the "sourceness" or "sinkness" of a field and is always associated with the concept of *flux*, denoted `$\nabla\cdot\pmb{F}$` or `$\mathrm{div}\pmb{F}$`.

The expression `$\left.\nabla\cdot\pmb{F}\right|_p\geq 0$` indicates that there is a *source* at point `$p$`, meaning the field is "spreading out" from that location. Conversely, `$\left.\nabla\cdot\pmb{F}\right|_p\leq 0$` suggests a *sink*, where the field is "converging" or "flowing into" the point. `$\left.\nabla\cdot\pmb{F}\right|_p=0$` means the vector field is neither expanding nor contracting at that point, which is often interpreted as the field being conservative or incompressible.

The coordinate-free definition of "divergence" is generally stated as the volume density of the outward flux of a vector field from a closed infinitesimal volume `$V$` around a given point `$\pmb{x}_0$`. Mathematically, this is given by
`$$\left.\nabla\cdot\pmb{F}\right|_{\pmb{x}_0}=\lim_{V\to 0}\frac{1}{|V|}\subset\kern{-3pt}\supset\kern{-16.5pt}\iint_{S(V)}\pmb{F}\cdot\pmb{n}\,\mathrm{d}S, \tag{3} \label{eq3}$$`
where `$|V|$` and `$S(V)$` are the volume and closed surface of `$V$`, respectively. `$\pmb{n}$` denotes the outward unit normal to that surface.

### Representation in Cartesian Coordinates
The above definition (Equation `$\eqref{eq3}$`) is rarely used for directly calculating the divergence due to its lack of intuitiveness. Actually the definition of divergence can be simplified reasonably when working with Cartesian coordinates.

Consider an infinitesimal rectangular parallelepiped centered at `$(x,y,z)$`, as shown in Fig. 1. We here first calculate the surface integral of an arbitrary vector-valued function `$\pmb{F}(x,y,z)$` over two opposing surfaces, `$S_1\text{ and }S_2$`. When the volume shrinks to zero, the surface integral can be approximated as `$\pmb{F}\cdot\pmb{n}$` at the center of that surface multiplied by the surface area. Therefore, we have
`\begin{align}
\iint_{S_1}\pmb{F}\cdot\pmb{n}\,\mathrm{d}S&=\iint_{S_1}F_x(x,y,z)\,\mathrm{d}S\approx F_x\left(x+\frac{\Delta x}{2},y,z\right)\Delta y\,\Delta z; \tag{4} \label{eq4}\\
\iint_{S_2}\pmb{F}\cdot\pmb{n}\,\mathrm{d}S&=-\iint_{S_2}F_x(x,y,z)\,\mathrm{d}S\approx -F_x\left(x-\frac{\Delta x}{2},y,z\right)\Delta y\,\Delta z. \tag{5} \label{eq5}
\end{align}`

With Equations `$\eqref{eq4}$` and `$\eqref{eq5}$`, the surface integral of `$\pmb{F}$` on two opposing surfaces is given by
`$$\lim_{V\to 0}\frac{1}{|V|}\iint_{S_1+S_2}\pmb{F}\cdot\pmb{n}\,\mathrm{d}S=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{F_x\left(x+\frac{\Delta x}{2},y,z\right)-F_x\left(x-\frac{\Delta x}{2},y,z\right)}{\Delta x}=\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x},$$`
similarly, the other two groups of surface integrals are obtained. Finally, we arrive at the divergence of a continuously differentiable vector field `$\pmb{F}$` under the Cartesian coordinates
`$$\nabla\cdot\pmb{F}\triangleq \mathrm{div}\pmb{F}=\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}.$$`

### Gauss's Theorem (Divergence Theorem)
In this section, we present a famous theorem regarding the divergence, namely **Gauss's Theorem**, which <font color=Crimson>relates the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the divergence of the field over the enclosed volume.</font> Let `$\pmb{F}$` be a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of a closed volume `$V$`, and let `$S=\partial V$` be the (piecewise smooth) boundary of that region. The Gauss's Theorem states that
`$$\iiint_V\nabla\cdot\pmb{F}\,\mathrm{d}V=\subset\kern{-3pt}\supset\kern{-16.5pt}\iint_S\pmb{F}\cdot\pmb{n}\,\mathrm{d}S, \tag{6} \label{eq6}$$`
here, `$\mathrm{d}\pmb{S}$` can be adopted as a shorthand for `$\pmb{n}\mathrm{d}S$`. One can refer to [this webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem#Informal_derivation) for informal derivations of Equation `$\eqref{eq6}$`.

In Cartesian coordinates, the vector-valued function can be expressed as `$\pmb{F}=P\pmb{i}+Q\pmb{j}+R\pmb{k}$`. Therefore, equation `$\eqref{eq6}$` reduces to the familiar form
`$$\iiint_V\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial R}{\partial z}\right)\,\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y\mathrm{d}z=\subset\kern{-3pt}\supset\kern{-16.5pt}\iint_S P\,\mathrm{d}y\mathrm{d}z+Q\,\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}z+R\,\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y.$$`
