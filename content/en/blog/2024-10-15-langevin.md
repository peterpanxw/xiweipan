## Preface
This blog will mainly focus on mathematical derivations of the (discrete time) Langevin equation (Equation (1) in [this blog](https://xiweipan.com/en/2024/07/15/diffusion-model-score/)) and its role in machine learning without delving too much into the field of *statistical mechanics*. For specifics on physics, one can refer to the classical book [*Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zwanzig) by [Robert Zwanzig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zwanzig).
