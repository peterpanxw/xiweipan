## Preface
To be honest, this is my first time diving into the Python code behind deep learning. While I’ve previously worked with multilayer perceptrons as surrogate models for structure-property pairs, that didn’t require much in terms of network architecture. In fact, you could easily get started using MATLAB’s [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html). In [my previous blogs](https://xiweipan.com/tags/diffusion-models/), we discussed the theoretical derivation of diffusion models, so I’d like to take this opportunity to walk through the code implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and explore the logic behind building deep learning networks in PyTorch.
